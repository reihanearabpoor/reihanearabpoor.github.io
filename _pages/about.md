I'm Reihane Arabpoor, a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I am a member of the [Smarture Lab](https://smarture.lab.uic.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Azadeh Haghighi](https://smarture.lab.uic.edu/about.html). I received my B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. My research spans **Additive Manufacturing**, **3D Printed Electronics**, **Aerosol Jet Printing**, **Multiphysics Simulations**, and **Machine Learning for Manufacturing**.

I am particularly interested in investigating interfacial fluid mechanics and complex surface printing in aerosol jet printing for electronics manufacturing. My work combines experimental studies, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and machine learning–based models to enhance print quality and process design for conformal printing of electronics with high precision. Additionally, I work on thermal analysis of complex trajectories in metal additive manufacturing using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

I am seeking internship opportunities in R&D, advanced manufacturing, and process planning & optimization.
